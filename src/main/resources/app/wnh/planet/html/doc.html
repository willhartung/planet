            <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
            <p>Planet, a simple planet generation application.</p>
            <p>Planet is an application that allows the user to create a variety of simple planets with computer generated
                terrain. It utilizes the work of Torben Mogensen, who's website at <a href="http://hjemmesider.diku.dk/~torbenm/Planet/">http://hjemmesider.diku.dk/~torbenm/Planet/</a>
                appears to be down at the moment. There is a copy of the website at archive.org, the Internet Wayback Machine,
                at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230603115922/http://hjemmesider.diku.dk/~torbenm/Planet/">https://web.archive.org/web/20230603115922/http://hjemmesider.diku.dk/~torbenm/Planet/</a></p>
            <p>The original is a model implemented by a C program and is free to use. For this application, the C program was ported, quite literally,
                to Java, and then an interface was built around the model to make it easier to use. The website contains a
                manual for the original application, as well as papers and slides about how the program works. I will not
                go into detail here about how it works, I can not say I fully understand it anyway.</p>
            <p>The fundamental premise is that the generator starts with a numeric seed. With this numeric seed, it will always 
                generate the same planet. It is a fractal generator, which will gain detail as you zoom into the renderings of the planet.
                The rest of the parameters to the system affect what the generated planet, and the final image, looks like.</p>
            <h2 id="the-10-second-exploration">The 10 Second Exploration</h2>
            <p>Simply, run the program and you are presented with a &quot;Planet - Untitled&quot; window. Click the Render button at the bottom
                of the window, and you will see a small planet image presented.</p>
            <p>You can play with the Projection selections, and/or the Color Scheme values, and click the Render button again.</p>
            <p>The Projections are used to change what kind of map is generated from the generated planet. The default Peter 
                projection is a cylindrical projection, similar to Mercator (which is the projection most people are familiar with),
                but does not distort the land masses as much.</p>
            <p>The Color Schemes are different color combinations which can try to make the planet look like a terrestrial planet,
                or some far off science fiction world.</p>
            <p>Try the <strong>Print Map</strong> and <strong>Show 3D</strong> options from the <strong>Tools</strong> menu.</p>
            <h2 id="main-window-controls">Main Window Controls</h2>
            <p>The main window is divided up into a parameter section on the left, and the image section on the right.</p>
            <p>The parameter section is broken up into 5 areas.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Planet Generation</li>
                <li>Positioning</li>
                <li>Environmental</li>
                <li>Presentation</li>
                <li>Properties</li>
            </ul>
            <p>There are also four command buttons: Export, Copy, Render, and Defaults.</p>
            <h3 id="planet-generation">Planet Generation</h3>
            <p>The parameters in this panel affect the generation and basic rendering of the planet.</p>
            <p>The Planet Generation Parameters are as follows.</p>
            <p><strong>Seed</strong> - This is the numeric seed that governs the generation of the planet. It is a floating point number. It's
                fraction, but it can be any floating point number. Since this is the seed to an effectively random number, there's
                no rhyme or reason as to what seeds produce what kind of planets.</p>
            <p><strong>Random Seed</strong> - This button simply populates the Seed with a random number.</p>
            <p><strong>Lock Seed</strong> - This check box prevents the Seed from being changed. It seemed worthwhile that after finding a planet with characteristics
                that you like, losing the seed while playing with all of the other parameters would be unfortunate. So, you can lock the
                seed to prevent unintentional change.</p>
            <p><strong>Projection</strong> - The projection of the map used to represent the planet. If you imagine the generated planet not so much as a
                planet at all, but rather and crystalline ball, with rough edges etc., and then put a bright light in the middle, you can
                better appreciate the mechanics of what are going on here. In truth, there is no &quot;planet&quot; as you would think of one
                within the system. It's just an abstract fractal blob, and then it's project onto a map, with the results that just so
                happen look like a planet. </p>
            <p><strong>Height</strong> - The image height of the generated image.</p>
            <p><strong>Width</strong> - The image width of the generated image.</p>
            <p><strong>Color Scheme</strong> - The color scheme used to present the various altitudes of the areas on the planet.</p>
            <p><strong>Water %</strong> - This is a selector that allows you to generate a planet with a certain amount of water. Perhaps you
                want a water world, or a desert world. This is one way to affect that. Use this selector with the Search button
                below it.</p>
            <p><strong>Search</strong> - This button generates several random planets internally, until it finds one that lies within
                the selection Water % range. Because of the way it works, it's possible for it to find worlds just
                outside of the specified range. For example, if you chose 50%-59%, you may get a planet with 49% or 60%.</p>
            <p><strong>Actual %</strong> - This is the percentage of water that's closer to the actual coverage of the generated world. 
                Because it uses small renderings to search for the planets, the actual percentage isn't isn't known until the
                large image is generated. This will only show for the PETERS projection.</p>
            <h3 id="positioning">Positioning</h3>
            <p>The parameters in the Positioning pane affect the position of the planet compared to the camera used
                for the map projection.</p>
            <p>The <strong>Latitude</strong> and <strong>Longitude</strong> represent at what latitude and longitude of the planet is at the center
                of the rendered map. </p>
            <p>The sliders mate to the nearby Lat and Long fields.</p>
            <p>The Sun Lat and Long parameters represent where on the world the sun happens to be
                shining. This is used later, with the Daylight shading option.</p>
            <p><strong>Scale</strong> - Scale represents the magnification of the projection. Using a combination of the Latitude 
                and Longitude values and the Scale field, you can zoom in on to specific areas of the map.</p>
            <h3 id="environmental">Environmental</h3>
            <p>The Environmental section has parameters to change features on the planet based on the 
                temperature of the zone (poles being cooler).</p>
            <p><strong>Latitude</strong> - With this option greater than zero, the colors are changed based on the latitude 
                of the terrain, instead of just the altitude. Simply put, the higher this number,
                the colder and frostier the poles will become.</p>
            <p><strong>Temperature</strong> - When checked, instead of seeing colors based on altitude, you will see
                colors based on the temperature of the land, based on latitude and altitude.</p>
            <p><strong>Biomes</strong> - The model has a series of colors representing different biomes. Biomes
                (e.g. Tundra, Grassland, Desert) are determined by a combination of rainfall and
                temperature. The colors below sea level for the color scheme are unchanged, but 
                above sea level the colors are replaced with colors to represent each biome.</p>
            <p><strong>Base</strong> - Base is the initial altitude of the model. -0.02 is just below sea level.
                The most notable impact of changing this value is raising and lowering the sea level
                of the planet. This is another way to tune how much water is available on the planet.</p>
            <h3 id="presentation">Presentation</h3>
            <p><strong>Outline</strong> - this checkbox determines whether an outline of the continents is added.</p>
            <p><strong>Black and White</strong> - this checkbox, combined with the Outline option, simply outlines
                all of the continents. Both must be checked to produce the outline.</p>
            <p><strong>Contours</strong> - this value determines if contour lines are shown at different altitudes.
                The higher the number, the more contours are added to the map.</p>
            <p><strong>Coastal Contours</strong> - this value determines if contours are drawn in coastal waters.
                The higher the number, the more contour lines that are drawn.</p>
            <p><strong>Latitude Lines</strong> - this value is the number of degrees between latitude lines.
                If the value is 0, no latitude lines are drawn.</p>
            <p><strong>Longitude Lines</strong> - this value is the number of degrees between longitude lines.
                If the value is 0, no longitude lines are drawn.</p>
            <p><strong>Shading</strong> - this option determines what, if any, shading is done to the map.
                It has 3 options: <strong>Land and Sea</strong>, <strong>Land Only</strong>, and <strong>Daylight</strong>.</p>
            <p>When Land and Sea is selected, the contours of the map, both above and below sea level
                are shaded to provide a sense of the relief of the terrain. With Land Only, only
                the land part of the map is shaded. When Daylight is selected, the suns position 
                (as specified in the Positioning section), is used to provide a night and day affect
                on the map. In this mode, the Land is also shaded just like the Land Only option.</p>
            <h3 id="properties">Properties</h3>
            <p>The properties section is used to fill in any high level properties for the planet.
                These are only show when the Print Map option is used.</p>
            <p><strong>Name</strong> - the planet name.</p>
            <p><strong>Diameter</strong> - the planet diameter, in kilometers.</p>
            <p><strong>Location</strong> - a free form field for the location of the planet.</p>
            <p><strong>Profile</strong> - a characteristic summary of the planet, as used in some role playing games.</p>
            <h3 id="command-buttons">Command Buttons</h3>
            <p>There are four command buttons.</p>
            <p><strong>Export</strong> - the system prompts for a file name to save a PNG format copy of the planet image.</p>
            <p><strong>Copy</strong> - puts a copy of the image onto the system clipboard for pasting into other 
                programs.</p>
            <p><strong>Render</strong> - renders the current image of the planet.</p>
            <p><strong>Defaults</strong> - resets all of the values to their defaults, including the Seed. If the Seed is Locked, it
                will prompt before resetting the values. </p>
            <h3 id="menus">Menus</h3>
            <p>The system has three menus on the main pane. The File, Tools and Help menu.</p>
            <h4 id="file-menu">File Menu</h4>
            <p>The file menu has options for the typical file operations, including New, Open, 
                Save, and Save As.</p>
            <p>The file is in an unspecified JSON format. The file is simple, but tampering with the
                file can lead to undefined behavior.</p>
            <h4 id="tools-menu">Tools Menu</h4>
            <p>The tools menu give access to assorted utilities for the Planet generator, including
                Planet Finder, Print Map, 3D View, and Color Scheme Editor.</p>
            <h4 id="help-menu">Help Menu</h4>
            <p>The help menu gives access to a simple About dialog, and this help page.</p>
            <h3 id="tools">Tools</h3>
            <p>The system has four tools accessible by the Tools menu.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Planet Finder</li>
                <li>Print Map</li>
                <li>Show 3D</li>
                <li>Color Scheme Editor</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 id="planet-finder">Planet Finder</h3>
            <p>The Planet Finder tools makes it easier generate several planets at once in order help
                find the perfect planet. It has four parameters, three taken from the main window.
                Click the <strong>Generate</strong> button to create all of the planets. If you 
                double-click on any of the planets in the browser, it will create a new main
                planet window for that planet.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Projection</strong> - This is the projection you wish to view for each planet.</p>
            <p> <strong>Color Scheme</strong>  - This is the Color Scheme desired for each planet.</p>            
            <p><strong>Water %</strong>  - This is the water range for each planet.</p>
            <p><strong>No. to Generate</strong> - The number of planets to generate.</p>
            <h3 id="print-map">Print Map</h3>
            <p>The Print Map tool takes the current planet parameters and renders it using
                the Icosohedral projection. On top of that, it overlays borders, a hex diagram,
                and then wraps it all in a frame that display the values from the Properties section
                of the Main Window Controls. The hex size is simply the diameter of the planet
                (as set in the Properties section) divided by 35, as there are 35 hexes on the 
                equator of the map.</p>
            <p>There is a <strong>Print</strong> button which will bring up the respective
                system printer dialog box. The important aspect here is that most systems
                allow you to print to PDF from the dialog, so its easy to generate PDF
                versions of your maps.</p>
            <p>The <strong>Export</strong> button will take the map and save it to a PNG file
                for use in other programs.</p>
            <p>You may also use Drag and Drop to drag the map image into another application.</p>
            <h3 id="show-3d">Show 3D</h3>
            <p>This tool simply renders your current planet using the <strong>Peters</strong> projection, maps it
                onto the surface of a sphere in 3D, and starts it spinning. It's a great way to get an
                overall view of your planet.</p>
            <h3 id="color-scheme-editor">Color Scheme Editor</h3>
            <p>This tool is used to create and change the Color Schemes. The program bundles several
            Color Schemes that were provided along with the original planet.c source code. But also 
            allows you to change those or create new ones.</p>
            <p>A Color Scheme consists of four functional colors, and a list of other colors that 
                are used to color the altitudes of the generated planet. The four functional colors have
            pre-defined uses.</p>
            <p><strong>Background</strong> - This is the background color for the generated image.</p>
            <p><strong>Lat/Long Lines</strong> - This is the color for the Longitude and Latitude lines.</p>
            <p><strong>Outline 1</strong> - When using the outline options, this is the color of the primary outline.</p>
            <p><strong>Outline 2</strong> - When using the outline options, this is the color of the secondary outline.
            These appear when several outlines are selected, and show only on Land.</p>
            <p>The Altitude Colors are essentially used to define gradients of color when painting the terrain. A list of values and colors
            are used, defining steps in the color scheme. The system will generate altitudes along the entire spectrum of the color scheme,
            with low values representing the various water levels (deep, shallow, etc.) and higher value representing land and mountain levels.</p>
            <p>Sea Level is automatically assigned based on the mid point between the highest and lowest values.</p>
            <p>Colors are interpolated between each entry. The simplest example is the Grayscale which only has two 
                values, 5 and 255. All other colors are simply filled in between the two values. The Color Scheme can
                be considered a list of color gradients.</p>
            <p>The actual values used are mostly arbitrary, altitudes will be mapped linearly among the extremes.
                While most of the scheme run from 0 to 255, that's not a hard limit. The system accommodates over 65000
                different colors should you so choose.</p>
            <p>Usage should be straightforward.</p>
            <p>A Color Scheme is selected from the alphabetical list on the left, and displayed within the control grid
            to the right. To change an individual value, you can double-click on a cell and either update the Value directly,
            or, for the actual Color, you will be presented with a a Color Picker to select your color. Individual elements
            can be added or deleted using the <strong>+</strong> and <strong>-</strong> buttons. The elements will automatically
            sort based on the Value field.</p>
            <p>To create a new Color Scheme, select the appropriate <strong>+</strong> button beneath the Color Scheme list,
                and enter a new name. Names can not be reused. Similarly, use the <strong>-</strong> button to delete
                a Color Scheme.</p>
            <p>Color Schemes can be duplicated with the <strong>Duplicate</strong> button, and renamed with
            the <strong>Rename</strong> button.</p>
            <p>The Color Schemes are automatically persisted to disk in a file located in the OS specific location
                for user data. If that file is removed, it will be recreated when the application restarts.</p>
